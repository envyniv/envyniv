# How I engineered my own MIDI Keyboard (and so can you!)

## Basic Intro

Hello there, name's envy. You might know me from my friends' streams, (check out the links in the description), maybe you've seen a bunch of my content or even found me out through Last HOPE, my indev RPG game.

enough of introductions- let's get to the point.

## Why and How.

From the title of the video, a few questions might arise. let's tackle "Why" first, shall we?

So, if you were to look through amazon (or any other online retail website, for that matter) you'll quickly notice that there are tons, and i mean to stress this; TONS of high quality, MIDI devices for cheap. What makes them cheap is the fact they don't require any component other than a basic outer shell, a microcontroller, and a MIDI/USB port.

They still manage to overshoot the â‚¬50 euro line though, and since i wouldn't probably use one much, i decided i should make one myself, so i can both get what i want and i can also learn some stuff whi-

it's all a lie. I'm just a cheapskate.

Next up is; "How" am i going to do it?

What a silly
