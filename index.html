Hi. I'm Davide, but the internet people know me as "envyniv", rarely "nival", "envyn" and "envy" for friends.
<br>
I'm an aspiring Software Engineer/Programmer, with a passion for anything related to technology.
<br>
I'm also an Open-Source & Right to Repair advocate
<br>
I do the things I do for passion first, convenience second.
<br><br>
I don't have a source of income, but I plan on accepting donations for my FOSS works in the future.
<br><br>
My online presence starts in 2016, on the now defunct Google+ and Youtube.
<br>
At the time I was knows as DaviAwesome or TheBlackThunder.
<br>
Towards 2017, I started "rebranding" to Ninjight, that didn't last however, as in 2018 I decided to go by "Nival"
<br><br>
The moniker "envy" came to me during a moment of self-reflection, where I realized that I tend to be envious of the success of others.
<br>
As a way to set myself the objective to grow out of that, I decided to stick with it in 2019.
<br>
The <em>niv</em> part of the nickname is a part of the aforementioned "nival"
<br>
In the text logo, N and V are emphasized as they are the only letters shared between <em>envy</em> and <em>nival</em>.
<br>
If the "e" is rotated 180Â°, it could be read as an "a".
